# DUET3D_CNC_Probe
CNC Probe plugin for DUET 3D boards (firmware 3.3 and above)


REMEMBER to attach both ends of the probe to the correct port and have it setup in your config.g, 
you also need to position the probe bit correctly before starting if you don't you may snap a bit
and no responsibility will be taken for any damage that may result.
